# Website samples

Note that I'm still checking some of the copyright and  licenses of some of
this content.  It's probably okay to distribute it because we've been
distributing it through the website, however the terms under which we
distribute it aren't clear.

## Books

I wouldn't say that books are "simple" to typeset.  There are a lot of small
details, especially for publishing in large volumes.  However visual design
isn't emphasised as much as it is with some of the other examples.

All of these books also use existing material, they're good examples of how
one can use CSS to style some existing HTML or XML content to create PDFs.
